function [c,I]=p_rcard(m,n)
%RCARD   Uniformly distributed random cards.
%   C = RCARD(N) is an N-by-N matrix with random cards (uniformly
%   distributed).
%   C = RCARD(M,N) and RCARD([M,N]) are M-by-N matrices with random
%   cards.
%   C = RCARD is a single card with random value and suit.
%
%   Note that it is the suits and values of the cards in the matrix
%   that are randomized. The layout of the cards (created by RCARD)
%   when plotted is the same as used by the CARDS function
%   (i.e. uniformly spaced and dealt downwards).
%
%   C = RCARD(C) randomizes the values and suits for each card
%   in the card matrix C. All other properties of the cards remain
%   unaltered except for their suits and values which will be random.
%
%   [Co, I] = RCARD(C) randomizes the order of the cards in the
%   card matrix C. The output I contains indices such that the
%   output Co = reshape(C(I),size(C)).
%   The extra output argument causes RCARD to randomize the order of
%   the cards rather than assigning random values and suits to the
%   cards, as above.

function c=p_cards(m,n)
%CARDS   Card array.
%   CARDS(N)  is an N-by-N matrix of card objects.
%   CARDS(M,N) or CARDS([M,N]) is a M-by-N matrix of card objects.
%   CARDS(SIZE(A)) is a matrix of card objects with the same size of
%   matrix A.
%
%   The resulting card matrix has its cards arranged in such a way
%   that when plotted, they are separated by xstep = 100% and ystep = 50%.
%   Also when plotted, the card at row = column = 1 is located
%   at the topmost leftmost card on the table.
%   The cards are distributed on layers that are increasing with the
%   row number (cards are dealt downwards).
%   The size of the cards (height) is unity and the lowest
%   leftmost card of the pack is having its lower left corner at (0,0).
%   All cards are visible, turned face up and have value and suit
%   ace of clubs.
